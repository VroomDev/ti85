# 85s2lvl Level Decompiler

Included in here is an attempt to make sense of the compiled levels.  It become important to decompile the levels when I noticed there was a few bugs in the level designs.
The decompiler itself is written in some crude C++ code, my apologies for that.

The .exe is only for MS-DOS.  It would be best to only compile the C++ code and use that for your intended machine.
