Make Level (cmklvl) is the level compiler for the game named Caves.

o History:
   v1.6: Now uses 42 character comment, instead of only 21.
   v4.0: Introduction of $T,$P,$S,$A variables.

o How to use:

CMklvl takes two arguments, an input file name and a output file name.  An
optional third option sets the title of the LVL program. The input file has
the following format.  The first line is a 42 character comment that will
be placed in the output file.  The second line is the number of levels in
the input file, it must be either 1,2,4, or 8.  The next 32 line blocks are
used to define a level.  Optionally contained in the file may be graphical
data.  Please see example.lvl for more details.

o Map Items:

Each level item is one of the charecters in the string
".PMmcsfFBStbDkW".  The meanings are as follows:
   .  blank spot
   P  a person (friends that you must protect)
   M  moveable brick, gravity pulls down* (#M0,#M1 is walking monster pic)
   m  another stationary monster (fliers) statue
   c  gem/coin treasure (monsters dont take gems anymore)*
   s  scroll, need one per level
   f  fire
   F  a bomb*
   B  stationary bullet (if pushed down upon, the player will jump high)
   S  a blood stain*
   t  a temporary shootable block*
   b  a brick
   D  a door*
   k  a key
   W  a shootable brick for secret passages
   X  the place where the player starts

      *Items marked are pulled downward by gravity.

o Some things to remember are:

   1.  P is not where the player is placed.  Rather they can act as
       friends that the player must protect.
   2.  M are moving blocks, meaning that gravity pulls them down.
   3.  If B is used, it can be thought of as an obstacle or jump pad.
   4.  Make sure there is a scroll in the level.
   5.  Make sure every door has a key.
   6.  The player starts in the upper left hand corner, if no X on map.
   7.  Monsters place themselves randomly.
   8.  Only one start location "X" per level, obviously.
   9.  "W" graphic is the same as a "b" graphic.

o Redefining Graphics:

There is the ability to redefine graphics.
To redefine the player pic for example, you do:

#P0        ; redefine first Player pic
10100101   ; This picture is not interesting...
00000000
00000000
00000000
11111111
11111111
11111111
11111111

The above would redefine the first player pic and since the player animates,
you should redefine #P1 as well, the second player pic.  This works for
all map item types.  However, BStbDk have only "0" pic.  .PMmcsfF have "0"
and "1" pics.  ALL graphics are 8x8!

Please note:  When you redefine #M0 or #M1 graphics, you are not redefining 
the picture of a falling brick, but rather a walking monster.

o $ variables:

    Syntax example:     Comment:
  $T="Hello"            The LVL name in the zshell pick list, 8 chars.
  $S=" Hello World "    The story name, 21 chars.
  $A=" by Nobody "      The authors name, 21 chars.
  $P="  Top player is"  The high score line, 16 chars.

The $S and $A are equivalent to (and replace) the comment line.
No spaces can appear in the expression and the string cannot span multiple
lines, ie the following is INVALID:
               $T = "Hello
                  "

o Compiling:

When you are done creating your level, do:

   mklvl  mylevel.lvl  mylevel
   string85  mylevel

And then transfer mylevel.85s to your calc.  Make sure SENGINE is on your
calculator. Now run mylevel as a normal ZShell program.  Please note that
"mylevel" can be any name.
