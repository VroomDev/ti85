Star Trek II - Shore Leave
                      8 LVLs
	After thwarting Lore's evil droids, Picard decides it time for 
the crew to go on shore leave.  However, Lore creates new droids to 
attack, and guess what, Picard happended to choose the same planet Lore 
is going to attack for shore leave!

	Once again, Picard, (the Star Fleet Pin) must get to the control 
panels to turn on the planetary shields.  Keys are scattered around from 
all the commotion evacuating the planet, and most of the doors still 
work.  However, the planet's crust is composed of a high metal content, 
so Picard will only be able to phaser some walls/floors/ceilings.
(Note: I put in a lot of secrets, so phaser all of the walls, floors and 
ceilings you suspect. Sometimes it's the only way to get to a key.)
Secrets: If you get a key out of it, it's NOT an "official" secret.
