# Ti85 Calculator Games

Hello, I am Chris Busch and I wrote Caves, Scrolls and Crunch games for the Ti85 Graphics Calculator back in the late 1990s.  I thought this source code was lost but I was able to find some old floppy disks and recover most of the source code. I am missing the level compiler source (presumably in C++) and the source code for the the level handler code.  However, if one has access to an MS-DOS machine they can still create levels and compile them to 85s files.

My goal is to port this to a newer TI Graphics Calculator or maybe port it over to a Windows Z80 emulator that would not require TI85 ROMs.

Note: there are some extra ASM files in this repo that I need to clean up. 

I compile this code on a Win95 box and use a floppy to get it to a computer that has internet access.  Sneaker net indeed.
