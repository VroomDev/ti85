================================================================
 - (for keyboard controlls refer to SENGINE documemtation)
 - Alien Abduction is a 2 level SENGINE lvl package.
 - It requires ZShell(really?) and SENGINE 3.0
 - by the way, this can be distributed as much as you like, just 
   make sure to distrbute the zip that is posted with this file.
=============================GAME PLAY==========================
 o In Alien Abduction, you are plowing your fields, or whatever 
   it is farmers do, when you come accross crop circles in your 
   fields.  Having read many articles in that well respected 
   newspaper, The Enquirer, you run into your house and grab your 
   rifle and as much ammunition as you can find (which is quite a 
   bit), as a second thought, you grab a bunch of gasoline bombs 
   (cocktails).  You run back outside and are overwhelmed by tons 
   of aliens, and little flying saucer droids.  Their spaceship 
   is in the center of your fields.  All of your crops have been 
   ruined, squashed flat.  But radio-active corn stalks are rapidly 
   growing.  
   You see chunks of precious metal on the ground, and you, being 
   the greedy person you are, grab as many of these as you can.
   Watch out for syringes, those mean alien doctors who want to  
   perform medical examinations on you.  
   And also, as you are a member of the little tikes junior astronomy 
   club, recognize that these aliens have a starmap, which you must 
   grab to benefit modern science.   
 o In the second level, the aliens have abducted you for snatching 
   their starmap, so you are on their ship.  Escape, grab the starmap
   (again)...and YOU WIN!

 o more levels (either 2 or 6) will come eventually, but not soon, 
   because I am also working on a ZShell version of Frogger (my first
   real program for ZShell!)
