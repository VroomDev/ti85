POCMAN LVL requires Scrolls 3.0 SENGINE to play.

o Story:

Ms. Pocman is being held hostage by ghosts!  Its your job as Mr. Pocman to
rescue her.

o Tips:

  . The big power pellets allow you to destroy certain types of blocks.
  . Gobble up the little pellets before the ghosts do.
  . Ghosts like to eat cherries (you think they taste ishy) and leave
    droppings behind.  Those droppings hurt you because they stink so bad.
  . You have powerful ghost traps that you borrowed.  Use them!

If you like Pocman, please email me telling me so.
Most of all, have fun!
