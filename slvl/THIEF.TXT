I. Requirements to use Thief
       1. A TI-85 Calculator
       2. ZShell 4.0
       3. SENGINE 4.0

       Thief uses standard Scrolls commands: the arrows move around, 2nd

III. The story of Thief
       In thief, you play (and a big surprise here) a thief who is intent on
       commiting the biggest heist in history. You have insider knowledge
       that the famous mad inventor, Dr. ImalÅney, has hidden in his castle
       a rather large sum of money, to the tune of three billion pesos. You
       one day decide that you will relieve the poor, old doctor of this
       burden by quietly removing it in the night. Unfortunatley, you didn't
       plan on the inventor's latest invention, the Secure-o-Tron 5001. The
       Secure-o-Tron is a nasty device which, when activated, will release
       hoardes of robots upon an intruder. These robots will then chase down
       the intruder until he is overtaken. If that's not bad enough, the room
       which contains all the money is securely locked behind many doors. Good
       luck getting the keys.

This is my first LVL for scrolls, so I hope you don't find it too cheezy. Look
for my first real ZShell game, Worlds of Magic 1 : Spirit War, which is an
awsome RPG set in the American East Coast befor Europeans arrived. Instead of
the traditional psuedo-medevil atmosphere, you will play as a member of the
Lenni Lenape tribe, who have their own ideas about war, bravery, and magic.
In the Worlds of Magic series, I hope to create inovative RPGs using various
cultures from around the world as a base. This way, I hope you don't grow
of the same formula that has been used in RPGs since their conception: the
'knights, wizards, theives', the 'trolls, dragons, demons, giants' etc. By
using the stories of peoples the world over, I hope to bring new ideas to the
world of RPGs. Look for my ZShell program Script85 on ticalc.org It allows
you to add full-sized text to the graph screen, the first program to do so.
