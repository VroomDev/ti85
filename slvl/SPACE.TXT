      (c) 1996 by Christopher Busch (cbusch@d.umn.edu)

Space LVL requires SENGINE to play.

o Story:

You are a astronaut who was sent to the moons of Jupiter to collect
mineral samples and perhaps find life.  Well, you did find life! But that
life is posionious to you.  However, they still want to be friends, so they
keep on trying to commicate to you.  So you must fight back either with
your blaster, or by setting small nuclear devices.

Occasionally, a meteor strikes the moon that your are on.  Those small
craters are harmless to you, but the lifeforms breath poisonous sulfuric
acid, so they dig out the craters to make volcanoes.  Those volconoes
hurt you, so watch out.

Sometimes, breccia (rubble) blocks your path, so you must move it.  You
can only carry one chunk at a time.  However, NASA insists that you put
the rubble in pits in the ground, so your rocket blast doesnt kick up
lose debris.

On each level, you must collect Jovian minerals, and find your way back
to your space ship.

o Controls:

Use [2nd] to fire your blaster; arrows to move; with [8],[6],[1] and [.]
to aim in different directions.  [Cos] will half your score and set your
lives to two. Use [Alpha] to set up a nuclear trap in front of you.  Press
