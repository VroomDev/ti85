Robot World LVL
(c) 1996 by Christopher Busch

Robot World LVL requires SENGINE to play.

o Story:

You are a student in the year 2015 trying to finish his robotics project
on time so you can recieve an between an A+ and an A-.  You need that
grade to graduate.  However, all of your robots have a nasty bug.  They
tend to hurt people namely you.  So clean up the lab and attempt to recieve
a good grade!

o Tips:

Periodically, electical components fall on the floor and break.  Well, you
can't get harmed by that, its only a nuisance.  However, your robots
charge them electrically, so they spark.  So watch out.

Try to pick up as many batteries as you can.


Most of all, have fun!
